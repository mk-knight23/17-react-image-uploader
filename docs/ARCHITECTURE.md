# Architecture: 17-react-image-uploader

## Overview
A high-fidelity visual asset vault built with React 19 and Vite 6. Designed for creative studios, it emphasizes immersive gallery experiences, category-based archive management, and AI-driven asset enhancement concepts.

## Tech Stack
-   **Framework**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite 6
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion 12
-   **Icons**: Lucide React

## Core Logic
-   **Immersive Gallery**: Masonry-inspired grid with layout-stable entrance animations.
-   **Archive Management**: Semantic category filtering (Art, Tech, Cyber) and asset counting.
-   **Interactive Lightbox**: 3D-space modal transitions for deep asset inspection.
-   **AI Engine Concepts**: Integrated UI sections for neural upscaling and generative expansion simulations.

## Performance
-   Optimized image loading via Unsplash API integration.
-   Hardware-accelerated backdrop filters for high-fidelity glassmorphism.
-   Tree-shaken icon library and aggressive asset prefetching for sub-second user transitions.
