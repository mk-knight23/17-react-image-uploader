## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Cyber-Art / Immersive Archive** aesthetic. It uses a deep night void (#020617) as the primary canvas, accented by "Vault Rose" (Rose-500) and indigo-hued AI gradients to create a sense of premium creative intelligence.

## Design Patterns
-   **Visual Radii**: Aggressive 3rem - 4rem corner rounding for gallery cards and banners to soften the "Vault" geometry.
-   **Cyber-Filters**: Gradients and blurs to simulate "scanning" and neural processing layers.
-   **Tactile Navigation**: Glassmorphic nav bars with high-contrast active states.
-   **Immersive Detail**: Full-screen lightbox with heavy backdrop blurs (3xl) to isolate the creative focus.

## Color Palette
-   **The Void**: Deep Slate-950 (#020617)
-   **Vault Primary**: Rose-500 (#f43f5e)
-   **AI Accent**: Indigo-500 (#6366f1)
-   **Archive Muted**: Slate-500/700 (#64748b)

## Interaction Design
-   **Vault Entrance**: Staggered motion-delayed card reveals for the archive grid.
-   **Category Switching**: Fluid filter transitions with color-state persistence.
-   **Premium Hover**: Combined 110% scaling with gradient reveal and text focus for gallery assets.
